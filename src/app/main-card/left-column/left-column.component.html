		Even when I was little, developing computer programs interested me. I became
		involved in computer science when I started building small computer games in
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker_Studio">Game Maker</a>. As
		I dove into the world of programming at 14 years old, I developed websites
		and started writing simple code. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS,
		JavaScript, and PHP to show off the small video games that I made.

	<p>
		I've developed numerous applications being used in the real world - from
		small programs to this website. You can find some of my active projects and
		the code for this website on
		<a href="https://github.com/Whitcome">GitHub</a>.

		In my free time, I like to play guitar, sing, and master music in post
		production. You can find some of my music on
		<a href="https://soundcloud.com/davebpm128">SoundCloud</a>. I won first
		place for the song "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/davebpm128/tradition"
			>Tradition</a
		>" in McHenry County College's Voices Magazine in 2015. I'm also a proud
		Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America as of August 2014.
